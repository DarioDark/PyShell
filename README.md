# Simple Python Terminal
This project is a basic Python terminal designed to simulate the experience of a Linux terminal. It was created primarily to explore the features of customtkinter and to serve as a foundation for more complex projects. While the terminal itself doesn't have a practical application, it provides a platform for experimenting with custom GUI elements and functionality.

The terminal offers the following features:

- help: Displays a list of available commands and provides information on their usage.
- clear: Clears the terminal screen.
- exit: Closes the terminal.
- pyshell: Allows interaction with a Python shell to change certain properties.
- calc: Launches a basic calculator.

For more information on how to use each command, use the help command.
